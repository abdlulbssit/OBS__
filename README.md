## Troubleshooting

### System Audio Not Available

If system audio recording is not available:

1. Open Sound settings in Windows
2. Go to Recording devices
3. Right-click in the list and enable "Show Disabled Devices"
4. Find "Stereo Mix" or "What U Hear"
5. Right-click and enable the device
6. Set it as the default recording device

### Audio Quality Issues

- Adjust the volume sliders to find the optimal balance between microphone and system audio
- For best results, use headphones to prevent microphone feedback
- Default system audio volume is set to 30% to prevent echo
